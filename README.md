# A Parallel Discrete Event Simulation Engine with Examples

This repository contains a conservative parallel simulator with several examples (such as logic simulation, queuing network, etc), called xSim, I wrote it while working as a researcher in the Semiconductor Device Modelling Lab (SDML) at Shahed University as part of the following journal paper

**Note:** to make use of this project, the Parvicursor platform from this repository  https://github.com/poshtkohi/pads must be first installed.

**Licence:** Note that the code can be changed and reused as long as you keep the copyright inside and at the beginning of source files in the source directory unchanged. If this framework is used everywhere, it should be cited as _Alireza Poshtkohi, A Parallel Discrete Event Simulation Engine with Examples, <https://github.com/poshtkohi/pdes>_.
